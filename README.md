# Lesson 8 in Patrick's course

In this lesson we go into

- How Metamask injects in the browser and uses Infura nodes under the hood
- For the front end to work we are going to need:
  - provider/ connection to the blockchain
  - signer / wallet / someone with gas
  - contract we are interacting with
  - ABI & Address
- You can add aprivate key in metamask as an encrypted JSON object. We learned how to create
  a JSON encrypted object witch ethers in lesson 4. Pretty cool
- How to use ethers.js in the front end

- Nice intro to HTML, javascript and promises

- In this demo every time you interact with the blockchain (through the js functions in the front end) you declare the provider and the signer each time. That is a relief a thought I was doing something wrong in the dapps that I did before this course
